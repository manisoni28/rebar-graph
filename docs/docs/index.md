# Rebar

Rebar is a discovery tool that builds a graph model of your cloud infrastructure.  Rebar integrates with your infrastructure control plane to extract 
important metadata, which it then replicates into a graph database.


## Rationale

Most commercial software deployments are heterogenous in nature.   Your infrastructure is likely spread across cloud-providers, split into multiple accounts, spread across multiple regions and serving multiple environments.  

Some may be containerized, some may not.  Some may be running in Kubernetes and some may not.  If you are running Kubernetes, you probably have a number of clusters.
