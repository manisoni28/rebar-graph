# Rebar

Rebar maintains a real-time graph model of all your cloud infrastructure.

Rebar connects to your cloud and datacenter control planes, normalizes the data, and makes it avaiable in the world's best open-source graph database, Neo4j.

With data aggregated in a simple, easy-to-use, database, you will find it much easier to:

* Provide a awesome developer experience
* Increase visibility of all your infrastructure
* Build world-class DevOps / SRE capabilities
* Have security to bring joy rather than sadness
* Turn capacity planning and budgeting into something that you do not dread
* Solve compliance issues - the auditors might turn out to be your best friends

## Why Rebar?

Most large-scale software deployments are heterogenous in nature.  Your infrastructure is likely spread across cloud-providers, split into multiple accounts, spread across multiple regions and serving multiple environments.  The people using and managing that infrastructure are likely spread across your org-chart.  Multiple org-charts, actually.

Some of your stuff may be in kubernetes. Some might be containerized. Some might not. A lot may be in the cloud.  Some may be in your datacenter. You might even have some Oracle databases kicking around. Maybe not. But if you have one of any one of those things, you probably have a lot more than one.  Multiple datacenters. Multiple cloud providers. A bunch of kubernetes clusters. If this doesn't sound familiar, just wait.  You'll grow more successful, then one day you'll realize that your company is making hundreds of millions of dollars, but now you have AWS accounts sprouting from every crack in the road.

This. Is. Reality.

We eschew the idea that by migrating everything to [insert-latest-and-greatest-thing] you will achieve nirvana.  You probbly won't.  You can try, but it has been like this since the dawn of computers.  Minicomputers were supposed to be the end of the mainframe.  Client server was supposed to finish the job (and the minicomputers).  The web was supposed to kill all the stuff before it.  Then if only we can get all that heavy web infrastructure out into a cloud-native environment.  Now Serverless.  Along the way, someone probably thought that Puppet would fix it all. That probably didn't work so well.  Less Grover, more Chucky.

All moving in the right direction, but reality is that you're likely to have a little bit of everything.  You might have some really awesome cloud-native technology AND a mainframe.  Probably two.  There, I said it.  At least the minicomputers are gone.

The design philosophy of Rebar is that your success is inexorably tied to managing all this technology sprawl, not chasing rainbows and unicorns.  

Rebar will help you make it a litte less sad, and a lot more fun.  Let's make it awesome.
